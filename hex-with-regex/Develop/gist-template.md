## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors designate an absolute position that the following character must match in the string. 
'^' is used to match a character (or string of characters) at the beginning of a string
    example regex: ^ful
                will match: <strong>ful</strong>fill
                will skip: wonder<strong>ful</strong>
                
'$' is used to match a character or string of characters at the end of a string
    example regex: ful$
                will skip: <strong>ful</strong>fill
                will match: wonder<strong>ful</strong>
